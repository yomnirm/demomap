# demomap
hackathon demo application

# Steps to run the application in your local machine

1. Clone/Download the project to your local machine.
2. Download Brackets IDE from brackets.io
3. Extract the folder from the zip file(if you are choosing the download option). You should have the demomap folder.
4. Open Brackets and select the folder demomap
5. Go to the map.html file and click on the live preview button on the right top corner of the IDE.
6. This should fire up the local server and start the application :)
7. Click on Allow to grant location access to the map and you are good to go 

Alterantively, just go to the folder and open map.html in a broswer(I used Chrome). Most easy way!!
